  <description>So you just spent absurd amounts of time, steel, and components to make your first tesla coil, and what do you get? A massive target that, all-in-all, is not much better than a vanilla turret. No more! This patch gives you reduced costs on Rimatomics weapons and allows them to be fortified with other materials: conserving steel and potentially increasing HP.</description>
